# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement comprehensive Terms of Service functionality for the AWS simulator website. The Terms of Service will provide legal protection, clearly communicate the educational nature of the service, establish usage guidelines, and allow for future business model changes. The implementation will include both the legal document content and the necessary UI components to present and manage user acceptance of these terms.

2. WHEN the Terms of Service content is written THEN it SHALL clearly state the educational nature of the simulator and its non-affiliation with AWS
3. WHEN the Terms of Service document is created THEN it SHALL include provisions allowing for future business model changes without requiring new formal consent

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Terms of Service content is updated THEN the system SHALL increment the version number and update the "last modified" date
